**ERC20 and Vault Contracts README**

**Introduction:**
This repository contains two Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity: ERC20 and Vault. The ERC20 contract implements the ERC20 token standard, while the Vault contract provides a secure storage solution for managing token balances.

**ERC20 Contract:**
The ERC20 contract implements the ERC20 token standard, allowing for the creation and transfer of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain. It includes functionalities such as minting, burning, and transferring tokens.

**Vault Contract:**
The Vault contract provides a secure storage solution for managing token balances. It allows users to deposit and withdraw tokens securely, with additional features for managing access and permissions.

**Features:**

**ERC20 Contract:**
1. **Standard Compliance:** The contract complies with the ERC20 token standard, ensuring compatibility with various wallets and exchanges.
2. **Minting:** The contract owner can mint new tokens and distribute them to specified addresses.
3. **Burning:** Token holders can burn their own tokens, reducing the total supply.
4. **Transferring Tokens:** Token holders can transfer tokens to other addresses.

**Vault Contract:**
1. **Secure Storage:** The Vault contract provides a secure storage solution for managing token balances.
2. **Deposit Tokens:** Users can deposit tokens into their vaults, securing them against unauthorized access.
3. **Withdraw Tokens:** Users can withdraw tokens from their vaults, transferring them to specified addresses.
4. **Access Control:** The contract owner can manage access and permissions for depositing and withdrawing tokens.

**Usage:**

**ERC20 Contract:**
1. **Deploy the Contract:** Deploy the ERC20 contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. **Mint Tokens:** The contract owner can mint new tokens using the `mintTokens` function.
3. **Transfer Tokens:** Token holders can transfer tokens to other addresses using the `transferTokens` function.
4. **Burn Tokens:** Token holders can burn their own tokens using the `burnTokens` function.

**Vault Contract:**
1. **Deploy the Contract:** Deploy the Vault contract to the Ethereum blockchain.
2. **Deposit Tokens:** Users can deposit tokens into their vaults using the `deposit` function.
3. **Withdraw Tokens:** Users can withdraw tokens from their vaults using the `withdraw` function.
4. **Manage Access:** The contract owner can manage access and permissions for depositing and withdrawing tokens.

**Security Considerations:**
- Use caution when interacting with smart contracts, especially when handling tokens and ether.
- Implement proper access control mechanisms to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive functions.
- Ensure that only trusted entities have access to the contract owner's account, as they have significant control over the contract's functionalities.
